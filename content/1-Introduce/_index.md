#### Overview

This workshop guides participants through implementing multi-cluster Kubernetes management using **Cluster API** on AWS. Cluster API is a Kubernetes project that provides declarative APIs for cluster lifecycle management, enabling automation of cluster provisioning, upgrades, and scaling across multiple clusters.

#### Objective
- Automate Kubernetes cluster lifecycle (creation, scaling, upgrades, and deletion).
- Set up cross-cluster networking for seamless communication.
- Distribute workloads across clusters for high availability and scalability.
- Implement governance and security policies to ensure compliance and secure operations.
- Apply cost management strategies to optimize AWS resource usage.
- Define operational procedures for multi-cluster management.

The workshop uses AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) with Cluster API to manage multiple clusters, focusing on practical, hands-on implementation. By the end, participants will have a functional multi-cluster setup with automated lifecycle management, secure networking, and cost-optimized operations.
