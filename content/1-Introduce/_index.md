#### Overview

This workshop provides a hands-on guide to managing multiple Kubernetes clusters on AWS using **Cluster API**, enhanced with GitOps deployment via **Argo CD**. **Cluster API** offers declarative APIs for automating cluster lifecycle operations, including **provisioning, upgrades, scaling, deletion**.

Argo CD integration ensures consistent and auditable application delivery across clusters, aligning with GitOps best practices.

#### Objective
- Automate Kubernetes cluster lifecycle: provisioning, scaling, upgrades, and decommissioning.
- Manage multiple EKS clusters on AWS using Cluster API.
- Enable GitOps-based deployment across clusters with Argo CD.
- Focus on production-grade, scalable multi-cluster architecture.

By the end of this workshop, participants will have a robust multi-cluster management setup with automated operations and Git-driven deployment workflows.
